# ShinyR_Dashboard
A non-technical, user-friendly dashboard built with Shiny R, which assembles dataset display, keyword searching and custom filters.

## Background and functionality
I built this dashboard to support my team at *Global Key Advisors*. The task is to help our startup partners match with professional mentors in a startup incubation program. <br>
We have the dateset containing all the details ï¼ˆsuch as company, expertise and industry) of the mentors, and the startups have their preferances on mentors. <br> 
However, our partners are not always data experts and we don't want to just throw them a BIG Excel file and tell them to search with Ctrl-F or even write more complex filter functions. <br>

This is why the tool was developed - **it is a non-technical, user-friendly dashboard that assembles dataset display, keyword searching and custom filters.** <br>
It will maximumly reduce data analytical operations for its users and improve searching efficiency.
